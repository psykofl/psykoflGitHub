Hello, I'm Fabricio.

Until now, most of my projects were made for personal purposes, for fun or for learning.



===PCCA===
I have only one done project, it's name is PCCA, this software was made to automate a process
that before used to be done by using paper and pencil, it's about a routine on my actual job,
this software gets informations of a especial carrier person, who boards a train of the subway,
and wants help to disembark on his or her destination.
Inside the folder "PCCA20151127", has a copy of the most importants codes.
